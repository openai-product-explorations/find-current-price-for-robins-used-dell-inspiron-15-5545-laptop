# openai product investigations
This project is intended to provide useful artifacts such as examples, quick-starts and blog-based commentaries arising from trying and investigating openai products.

This project has directories which contain commentary, sometimes code, oftentimes images and videos (or links to those if they're too big to fit in github.com).

It is organized as a blog, and is a fork of https://github.com/pflagerd/blog-bootstrap .

You can browse it at https://openai-product-explorations.github.io/openai-product-explorations/
